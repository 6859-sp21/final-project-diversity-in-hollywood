## Abstract
Inspired by the #OscarsSoWhite movement in 2015, our visualization experience empowers users to explore diversity in Hollywood, and how the distribution of race and ethnicity relate to different measures of success: movie reception and awards. We bring together datasets on major awards (Oscars, Golden Globes, Screen Actors' Guild) and box office statistics and create digestible visualizations to see how white Hollywood really is. 

## Running Instructions

## Project Process & Contributions
The contributions made by each team member are listed below.

### Jenning
### Ashwin
### Cindy
### Lisa
- Created dropdown autocomplete search bar
- Implemented and styled reception comparison visualization
- Helped preprocess movies dataset
- Initial reception page styling & bubble plot

### Project Process
For our final project, we chose to extend the work we'd done for A4 because we thought there was still much to explore. We began by brainstorming potential extensions and additional visualizations to build on the narrative we already had, which included the new perspective of box office reception, inclusion of other acting/directing award datasets, and extra visualizations to better break down our awards datasets. Ashwin + Cindy worked on the awards page, while Jenning + Lisa worked on the reception page -- the process for each team was to gather/scrape datasets, spec out visualizations, then implement.
